At this time, a manual is being developed but you need to wait.

For now, there is no detailed documentation. The best way to proceed,
in order to understand how to use gneural_network, is to study the
very well commented example in the main() of gneural_network.c.

Please, do not hesitate to contact me at jeanmichel.sellier@gmail.com
if you have any question. I will be more than happy to answer your questions.
