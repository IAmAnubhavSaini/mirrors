.TH LSH-KEYGEN 1 "NOVEMBER 2004" LSH-KEYGEN "Lsh Manuals"
.SH NAME
lsh-keygen \- Generates a keypair and write it on stdout.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lsh-keygen
[\fIOPTION\fR...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B CAUTION! The information in this manpage may be invalid or outdated. For authorative
.B information on lsh, please see it's Texinfo manual (see the
.I SEE\ ALSO
.B section).

Generates a new private key for the desired algorithm 
and security level and write it on stdout.

You will usually want to pipe the new key into a program like
.B lsh-writekey,
to split it into its private and public parts, and
optionally encrypt the private information.


.SH OPTIONS


.TP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-algorithm\fR=\fIAlgorithm\fR
DSA or RSA. Default is to generate RSA keys
.TP
\fB\-l\fR, \fB\-\-nist\-level\fR=\fISecurity\fR level
For DSA keys, this is the NIST security level:
Level 0 uses 512-bit primes, level 8 uses 1024 bit
primes, and the default is 8. For RSA keys, it's
the bit length of the modulus, and the default is
2048 bits.
.TP
\fB\-\-server\fR
Use the server's seed-file
.TP
\fB\-\-debug\fR
Print huge amounts of debug information
.TP
\fB\-\-log\-file\fR=\fIFile\fR name
Append messages to this file.
.TP
\fB\-q\fR, \fB\-\-quiet\fR
Suppress all warnings and diagnostic messages
.TP
\fB\-\-trace\fR
Detailed trace
.TP
\fB\-v\fR, \fB\-\-verbose\fR
Verbose diagnostic messages
.TP
-?, \fB\-\-help\fR
Give this help list
.TP
\fB\-\-usage\fR
Give a short usage message

.TP
\fB\-V\fR, \fB\-\-version\fR
Print program version
.PP
Mandatory or optional arguments to long options are also mandatory or optional
for any corresponding short options.
.PP

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
See the 
.B --log-file
,
.B --verbose
,
.B --trace
and 
.B --debug
options.

.SH "REPORTING BUGS"
Report bugs to <bug-lsh@gnu.org>.



.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B LSH_YARROW_SEED_FILE 
may be used to specify the random seed file.
