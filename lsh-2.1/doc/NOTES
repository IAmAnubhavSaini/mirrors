NO PAM SUPPORT

I spent a day reading the PAM documentation. My conclusion was that
PAM is not at all suited for handling ssh user authentication. There
are three main problems, the first two of which would be show-stoppers
for any SSH server, while the last is a problem that affects servers
like lshd which doesn't fork() for each connection.

(i) The design of PAM is to hide all details about the actual
authentication methods used, and that the application should never
know anything about that. However, ssh user authentication is about
particular authentication methods. When the client asks which
authentication methods can be used, the server should be able to tell
it, for example, whether or not password authentication is acceptable.
When the client tries the password authentication method, no other
method should be invoked. But PAM won't let the server know or control
such details. This problem excludes using PAM for anything but simple
password authentication.

(ii) PAM wants to talk directly to the user, to ask for passwords,
request password changes, etc. These messages are not abstracted *at*
*all*, PAM gives the application a string and some display hints, and
expects a string back as the users response. This mode of operation
doesn't fit with the ssh user-authentication protocol. 

If PAM would tell the ssh server that it wanted the user to chose a
new password, for instance, the server could the appropriate message,
SSH_SSH_MSG_USERAUTH_PASSWD_CHANGEREQ, to the client, and pass any
response back to PAM. But PAM refuses to tell the application what it
really wants the user to do, and therefore there's no way the server
can map PAM's messages to the appropriate SSH packets. This problem
excludes using PAM for password authentication.

(iii) The PAM conversation function expects the server to ask the user
some question, block until a response is received, and then return the
result to PAM. That is very unfriendly to a server using a select()
loop to manage many simultaneous tasks. This problem by itself does
not exclude using PAM for a traditional accept(); fork()-style server,
but it is completely unacceptable for lshd.


DSS KEY GENERATION

I have implemented DSS key generation, using the method recommended by
NIST (algorithm 4.56 of Handbook of Applied Cryptography) to generate
the public primes. According to Werner Koch, the method used in GNU
Privacy Guard, suggested by Lim-Lee at Crypto '97, may be a lot
faster:

> I generate a a pool of small primes (160 bits for a prime up to 1024
> bits), multiply a couple of them, then double the result, add 1 and
> check wether this is a prime (5 times Rabin-Miller) and continue
> with a new permutation until I found a prime. (p = 2*q*p1*p2 ... *
> pn + 1).


EOF ON CHANNELS

A typical channel (i.e. all channels created in the current
implementation) are, at each end, connected to one or more fd:s for
reading and writing. When the source fd(:s), i.e. the fd:s that we are
reading, have no more data available, a CHANNEL_EOF message should be
sent. As there may be several such fd:s, we use a counter SOURCES in
the channel struct to keep track of the number of active source fd:s.
When an fd is closed, the counter is decremented, and when it reaches
zero, the CHANNEL_EOF message is sent.

The decrementing of the counter is done by the close-callback for the
fd, not by the read handler, as this is the easiest way to
ensure that it is called exactly once whenever a fd dies. However, the
sending of the CHANNEL_EOF message is done by the read handlers
do_channel_write() and do_channel_write_extended(). This is because
otherwise, eof on bidirectional fd:s migth be delayed until it is
closed also for writing. There are more unsolved issues with
bidirectional fd:s though, in particular tcp connections where one
direction is closed (with shutdown()) long before the other.


CLOSING CHANNELS

The right conditions for closing a channel, and in particular a
session, are even more subtle. The basic rules are:

1. When SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_CLOSE is both sent and received, the channel
   is killed. This is unconditionally required by the spec.

2. When SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_EOF is both sent and received,
   SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_CLOSE is sent. This is a rule with a few
   exceptions, controlled by the CHANNEL_CLOSE_AT_EOF flag, see below.

These two rules are sufficient for most channel types.

When looking at the channel close logic for session channels, one has
to consider these three events that may occur in arbitrary order:

 * The client sends SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_EOF on the channel.

 * The server sends SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_EOF on the channel (this happens
   when there are no more processes which have the files the server
   has opened for stdout or stderr open).

 * The child process created by the server dies. An exit-status or
   exit-signal message is sent to the client.

Previous versions of lshd handled these conditions as follows: It
closed the channel according to rule (2) above, no exceptions. This
causes other clients to hang, because they never send any
SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_EOF. Using lsh did work right, only because it
responded to the exit-status message with a SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_EOF.

But the server can't rely on clients sending SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_EOF.
Instead, it must treat process death in much the same way as reception
of SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_EOF. The channel is closed once the server has both
encountered EOF on the process' stdout and stderr (resulting in a
SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_EOF), and sent an exit-status or exit-signal message.

As a further complication, rule (2) must be relaxed, because otherwise
the channel may get closed before the exit-status message is sent.


PARSING USING STRUCT SIMPLE_BUFFER

I view the simple_buffer objects as bookkeeping objects only. They
don't own any storage. They are *always* allocated on the stack, and
are therefore short-lived and not garbage collected.

The idea is that you initialize a simple_buffer to parse some data, and do
all the parsing more or less immediately. When parsing is done, forget
the buffer object, and free the underlying data if appropriate.

In most cases, parsing looks like

  simple_buffer_init(&buffer, packet->length, packet->data);
  if (parse_*(&buffer, ...) && parse_*(&buffer, ...))
  {
    lsh_string_free(packet);

    /* No more uses of buffer, and no more calls to parse_* */

    return...
  }
  lsh_string_free(packet);
  return LSH_FAIL;

This usage pattern should be safe.

The do_channel_request() function is an exception, in that it
delegates some of the parsing to another method. It must therefore
keep the packet data around until that method has returned.
Conversely, the called method, CHANNEL_REQUEST, must assume that the
data associated with its buffer argument will disappear as soon as the
method returns; any data that is needed later must be copied.

The do_alloc_pty function in server.c observes this; it doesn't use a
copying method when extracting the mode string, *but* the string is
used only in the call to tty_decode_term_mode. If the method needed to
remember the string for later use, it would have to use
parse_string_copy instead.

In some cases some data from the buffer is needed later, and in those
cases, it should be copied out of the buffer using parse_string_copy.
But most parsing extracts integers from the buffer, in various ways,
and do not need to do any extra copying.


CLIENT SIDE OF USER AUTHENTICATION

About publickey authentication, one way to organize this as follows:

First, lsh.c parses its options and collects all -i keyfile options
into a list. By default, the list contains ~/.lsh/identity. There
should also be some way to specify an empty list, i.e. to disable
public key authentication.

Later on, we iterate through this list, and collect any private keys
we find into a list of keypairs. A file can contain zero or more keys,
and i/o and parse errors are not fatal errors. dss keys may split into
two keypair structures; one for "ssh-dss" and another for "spki" (this
splitting could be moved to later on, but I think that will require
some more information than the keypair struct to be kept around). The
list is passed on to the userauth mechanism, perhaps using something
like

  (publickey-login (map-append read-private-key-file file-list)
                   (userauth_service (handshake (connect port))))

When we have an agent, we will also ask the agent for additional keys
(a keypair from an agent will contain a public key and a "proxy
signer" object, which will create signatures by communicating with the
agent).

When getting into the userauth proper, we try all available keys, by
sending USERAUTH_REQUEST messages for all of the public key, and
whatching for USERAUTH_PK_OK replies. When we get one, we create a new
signature and send a new USERAUTH request. If all keys fail, we fall
back to password authentication.

At first, we'll support only one keyfile at a time, but we can still
have several keys.

Also the lshd server currently can't deal with multiple userauth
requests in parallell.

On a higher level, we may have several userauth methods that we want
to try, say first public key, then agent public keys, and last
password authentication.

I think the best way to keep track of this is to let the userauth
mechanism get a list of methods. It tries the first method; when it
failes, we should continue with the next useful method. To do this, we
advance one element on the methods list, and we also look at the list
of useful methods according to the latest USERAUTH_FAILURE message
from the server. Then we try the next useful method.

Perhaps each userauth method could be represented as a command? I
think it is better to handle the SETUP and CLEANUP done internally by
the method. Each userauth method should probably request the same
username and service.


SPKI SUPPORT

The current interface for SPKI operations consists of two classes.
spki_context and spki_subject.

An spki_subject holds at least one of the following items:

 * A public key
 * Hashes of the key
 * A verifier object, that can verify signatures created with a key.

Subjects are not necessarily trusted, but each subject must always be
internally consistent.

An spki_context contains a list of subjects and a list of 5-tuples. It
has two methods, lookup and authorize.

The LOOKUP method takes an s-expression which is a public key or a
hash (names should be added later). It tries to find a matching
subject in the list, or adds a new one if needed. LOOKUP returns a
subject, or NULL if the input s-expression was invalid.

The idea is that subjects in the same context (i.e. returned by the
LOOKUP method in the same spki_context object) can be compared by
simple pointer comparison. If LOOKUP is first called with a hash, a
subject will all attributes but the appropriate hash value left NULL is
returned. If LOOKUP is called later with a public key matching the
hash, the same subject is returned, but with the public-key and
possibly verifier attributes modified with the new information.

This should work in most cases. But consider this scenario: Assume
that we call LOOKUP three times with (i) md5 hash, (ii) sha1 hash, and
finally (iii) the matching public-key expression. The first two calls
will result in two distinct subjects. With the third call, we provide
new information, which is merged into one of the subjects. But the
other will stay around, with a NULL verifier attribute.

The AUTHORIZE method takes a subject and an "access description",
where the latter correspond to the bodies of SPKI (tag ...)
expressions. AUTHORIZE tries to find an ACL and certificate chain that
grants acces for the subject. Currently, only ACL:s are supported; no
certificates. AUTHORIZE returns 1 if access is granted and 0 if access
is denied.

For ssh hostkeys, the access description for the host
"foo.lysator.liu.se" is the s-expression (ssh-hostkey
"se.liu.lysator.foo"). Note that the components are in reversed order;
this makes it easier to create certificates for a subtree in the dns,
with a tag containing (* prefix "se.liu.lysator.").

There's one function to convert an ACL to a list 5-tuple:

  struct object_list *
  spki_read_acls(struct spki_context *ctx,
  		 struct sexp *e)

Perhaps this should be turned into a method, and we also need some
similar method for certificates. When adding a certificate, the
certificate signature must be verified, and this will fail unless the
issuer is already in the spki_subject-list, and with a non-NULL
verifier attribute.

Sharing spki_contexts requires consideration. Consider the server side
of user authentication, where each user may have a file of acls and
certificates to grant login access to his or her account. It's
tempting to use one single spki_context to keep track of all subjects.

And I think that it may be reasonable to do this for subjects and
certificates. They are (i) more or less public, and (ii) not empowered
unless there is an acl->certificate chain that grants power to the
key. ACL:s are an entirely different matter, though.

I could make sense to have a base context that contains names, acl:s
and certificates that the server (or its admin) trusts. For each user
authentication operation, first copy the base context, then add the
user's acl:s to it, and finally add the certificates supplied by the
remote peer. This extended context can be used for access decision,
without the base context being modified at all. On the other hand, it
might be a good idea to at least share the subject database.

I have to think some more about this.
