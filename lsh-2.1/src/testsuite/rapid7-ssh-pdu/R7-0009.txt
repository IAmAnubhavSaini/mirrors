2. Summary

   SSH servers and clients from several vendors contain vulnerabilities
   that may allow denial-of-service attacks and/or arbitrary code
   execution.  The vulnerabilities arise from various deficiencies in
   the greeting and key-exchange-initialization phases of the SSHv2
   transport layer.

5. Detailed analysis

   To study the correctness and security of SSH server and client
   implementations {2}, the security research team at Rapid 7, Inc.
   has designed the SSHredder SSH protocol test suite containing
   hundreds of sample SSH packets. These invalid and/or atypical
   SSH packets focus on the greeting and KEXINIT (key exchange
   initialization) phases of SSH connections.

   We then applied the SSHredder suite to some popular SSH servers
   and clients, observing their behavior when presented with a
   range of different input.  Several implementation errors were
   discovered, most of which involve memory access violations.
   While the impact is different for each product tested, some of
   these errors were easily exploitable, allowing the attacker to
   overwrite the stack pointer with arbitrary data.

   In most cases, only the most current versions of the applications
   were tested.  Vendors listed as "Apparently NOT VULNERABLE" are
   encouraged to run the tests against older versions of their
   applications.

   The SSHredder test suite is now available for download from
   Rapid 7's web site ( http://www.rapid7.com ).  A pre-release
   version of SSHredder was provided to SSH vendors for testing
   prior to public disclosure.  SSHredder has been released under
   the BSD license.

   The test cases combine several test groups of similarly
   structured data:

      o Invalid and/or incorrect SSH packet lengths (including
        zero, very small positive, very large positive, and
        negative).

      o Invalid and/or incorrect string lengths.  These were applied
        to the greeting line(s), plus all the SSH strings in the
        KEXINIT packets).

      o Invalid and/or incorrect SSH padding and padding lengths.

      o Invalid and/or incorrect strings, including embedded ASCII
        NULs, embedded percent format specifiers, very short, and
        very long strings.  This test group was applied to the
        greeting line(s), plus all the SSH strings in the KEXINIT
        packets).

      o Invalid algorithm lists.  In addition to the existing string
        tests, invalid encryption, compression, and MAC algorithm names
        were used, including invalid algorithm domain qualifiers;
        invalid algorithm lists were created by manipulating the
        separating commas.

   The individual tests in each group were combined systematically to
   produce a test suite of 666 packets.  A full permutation of every
   test in each test group would have yielded a test suite that is too
   large to distribute, so a representative sample of packets was
   chosen from each group.

   Please note that greeting and KEXINIT are only the first and second
   phases of SSH connections.  A full test suite for every SSH
   protocol message could potentially reveal other latent
   vulnerabilities.

6. Notes

   [1] While SSHv1 has no KEXINIT phase, many of these test cases
       could affect both SSHv1 and SSHv2 in a generic way).  SSHv1
       implementations were not tested.

   [2] The SSH protocol is described in several IETF drafts, which can be
       found at http://www.ietf.org/ids.by.wg/secsh.html .
