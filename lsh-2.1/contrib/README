This "contrib" directory is a collection of code/scripts sent to me by
contributors around the world. This README file will be kept
up-to-date from release to release. BUT, we must point out that these
contributions are really, REALLY UNSUPPORTED. In fact, we probably
don't even know what some of them really do. We certainly do not
guarantee to have tried them, or ported them to work with this LSH
distribution. If you have questions, your best bet is to contact the
original author.

The LSH author does not maintain these files. However, I'll try to
keep them updated if I get improved versions from the author of the
script/code in question.
